# Adversarial Examples for Models of Code - Code2vec

An adversary for Code2vec - neural network for learning distributed representations of code.
This is an official implemention of the model described in:

Noam Yefet, [Uri Alon](http://urialon.cswp.cs.technion.ac.il) and [Eran Yahav](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~yahave/),
"Adversarial Examples for Models of Code", 2019 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07517

<!-- _**October 2018** - the paper was accepted to [POPL'2019](https://popl19.sigplan.org)_! -->

This is a TensorFlow implementation , designed to be easy and useful in research, 
and for experimenting with new ideas for attacks in machine learning for code tasks.
Contributions are welcome.

## Requirements
On Ubuntu:
  * [Python3](https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/install-python-3-6-ubuntu-16-04-16-10-17-04). To check if you have it:
> python3 --version
  * TensorFlow - version 1.13 or newer ([install](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux)). To check TensorFlow version:
> python3 -c 'import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.\_\_version\_\_)'
  * For [creating a new dataset](#creating-and-preprocessing-a-new-java-dataset) - [Java JDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/)

## Quickstart
### Step 0: Cloning this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/noamyft/code2vec.git
cd code2vec
```

### Step 1: Creating a new dataset from java sources
In order to have a preprocessed dataset to attack the network on, you can either download our
preprocessed dataset, or create a new dataset of your own.

#### Download our preprocessed dataset (compressed: 200Mb, extracted 1Gb)
We provided a preprocessed dataset (based on [Uri Alon's Java-large dataset](https://github.com/tech-srl/code2vec)).

First, you should download and extract the preprocessed datasets below in the dir created earlier:

* [dataset for VarName & Deadcode atack](https://adversarial-examples.s3.amazonaws.com/adversarial+for+code2vec/java_large_adversarial_data.tar.gz)

Then extract it:
```
tar -xvzf java_large_adversarial_data.tar.gz
```

This will create directory named "data" with all the relevant data for the model and adversary.

<!--
### Creating and preprocessing a new Java dataset
In order to create and preprocess a new dataset (for example, to compare code2vec to another model on another dataset):
  * Edit the file [preprocess.sh](preprocess.sh) using the instructions there, pointing it to the correct training, validation and test directories.
  * Run the preprocess.sh file:
> source preprocess.sh
-->
### Step 2: Downloading a trained model
We provide a trained code2vec model that was trained on the Java-large dataset (thanks to [Uri Alon](https://github.com/tech-srl/code2vec)). Trainable model (3.5 GB):
```
wget https://code2vec.s3.amazonaws.com/model/java-large-model.tar.gz
tar -xvzf java-large-model.tar.gz
```

You can also train your own model. see [Code2Vec](https://github.com/tech-srl/code2vec)

<!-- #### Downloading a trained model (1.4G)
We already trained a model for 8 epochs on the data that was preprocessed in the previous step.
The number of epochs was chosen using [early stopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping), as the version that maximized the F1 score on the validation set.
```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/code2vec/model/java14m_model.tar.gz
mkdir -p models/java14m/
tar -xvzf java14m_model.tar.gz -C models/java14m/
```

-->
<!--
##### Note:
This trained model is in a "released" state, which means that we stripped it from its training parameters and can thus be used for inference, but cannot be further trained. If you use this trained model in the next steps, use 'saved_model_iter8.release' instead of 'saved_model_iter8' in every command line example that loads the model such as: '--load models/java14m/saved_model_iter8'. To read how to release a model, see [Releasing the model](#releasing-the-model).
<!--
#### Training a model from scratch
To train a model from scratch:
  * Edit the file [train.sh](train.sh) to point it to the right preprocessed data. By default, 
  it points to our "java14m" dataset that was preprocessed in the previous step.
  * Before training, you can edit the configuration hyper-parameters in the file [config.py](config.py),
  as explained in [Configuration](#configuration).
  * Run the [train.sh](train.sh) script:
```
source train.sh
```
<!--
##### Notes:
  1. By default, the network is evaluated on the validation set after every training epoch.
  2. The newest 10 versions are kept (older are deleted automatically). This can be changed, but will be more space consuming.
  3. By default, the network is training for 20 epochs.
These settings can be changed by simply editing the file [config.py](config.py).
Training on a Tesla v100 GPU takes about 50 minutes per epoch. 
Training on Tesla K80 takes about 4 hours per epoch.
-->

### Step 3: Run adversary on the trained model

Once you download the preprocessed datasets and pretrained model - you can run the adversary on the model, by run:

* for Varname Attack:
```
python3 code2vec.py --load models/java-large/saved_model_iter3 --load_dict data/java_large_adversarial/java-large --test data/java_large_adversarial/java_large_adversarial.test.c2v --test_adversarial --adversarial_type targeted --adversarial_target add
```

* for Deadcode Attack:
```
python3 code2vec.py --load models/java-large/saved_model_iter3 --load_dict data/java_large_adversarial/java-large --test data/java_large_adversarial/java_large_adversarial_with_deadcode.test.c2v --test_adversarial --adversarial_type nontargeted --adversarial_deadcode --adversarial_target merge|from
```

Where:
* _--load _ - the path to the pretrained model.
* _--load_dict _ - the path to the preprocessed dictionary.
* _--adversarial_deadcode _ - use DeadCode attack (note: you should also specify the path to the deadcode dataset)
* _--adversarial_type _ - targeted\nontargeted.
* _--adversarial_target _ - specify the desired target (for the "targeted" type). Names seperated by '|" (e.g. "merge|from")

You can also determine the BFS search's depth and width by setting the _--adversarial_depth_ , _--adversarial_topk_ parameters respectively (2 by default).

<!--
### Step 4: Manual examination of a trained model
To manually examine a trained model, run:
```
python3 code2vec.py --load models/java14m/saved_model_iter8 --predict
```
After the model loads, follow the instructions and edit the file Input.java and enter a Java 
method or code snippet, and examine the model's predictions and attention scores.
-->

### Manually examine adversarial examples
You can run the examples we provided in the paper on the Code2vec's **online demo**. available at [https://code2vec.org/](https://code2vec.org/).

* You can copy&paste the sort example from [here](https://adversarial-examples.s3.amazonaws.com/adversarial+for+code2vec/sort_adversarial_example.txt)

* you can type the following code in each example to get Prediction of sort:
```
int introsorter = 0;
```

## Defense

You can run the Outlier Detection defense by adding the _--guard_input_ with threshold to either:
* regular evaluation, e.g. :
```
python3 code2vec.py --load models/java-large/saved_model_iter3 --test data/java_large_adversarial/java_large_adversarial.test.c2v --guard_input 2.7
```

* adversarial evaluation. e.g.:
```
python3 code2vec.py --load models/java-large/saved_model_iter3 --load_dict data/java_large_adversarial/java-large --test data/java_large_adversarial/java_large_adversarial.test.c2v --test_adversarial --adversarial_type targeted --adversarial_target add --guard_input 2.7
```

## Configuration
Changing hyper-parameters is possible by editing the file [config.py](config.py).
Here are some of the parameters and their description:

#### config.MAX_WORDS_FROM_VOCAB_FOR_ADVERSARIAL = 100000
The vocabulary size of the adversary.
#### config.ADVERSARIAL_MINI_BATCH_SIZE = 256
